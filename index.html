### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I always knew how to play Blackjack in the 
    real world, and it was pretty cool to see it kind of come to life in the world 
    of code. It was a cool experience that was both fairly simple, as well as 
    challenging for what we had learned at the time. I was a little confused at times,
    but my partner explained things very well and I was able to learn from it.
    
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a fun little activity at the start of the year. It introduced
    me to the basics as well as a little more complicated aspects of coding. Overall,
    I remember this code being especially fun and satisfying to see work as it was
    one of our first labs of the year.
    
* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was really cool because it delved deeper into the math side of
    computer science and it was an actually useful piece of code to write. It had
    lots of functions that could be applied to other labs and was really satifying
    to use and think, "Wow, I really made this work." I also remember it being pretty
    challenging when I first looked at it which made it feel even better when it 
    finally worked.</p>
